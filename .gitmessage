# You might want to use one of this labels to prefix your commit message:
#
#   fix:
#   new:
#   change:
#   refactor:
#
# After editing the message, save and quit your editor, e.g. in vim
# with 'ZZ' or ':wq'. If you exit without modifing the message or
# with a blank message, the commit is aborted.
