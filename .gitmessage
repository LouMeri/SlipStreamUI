# NB: Lines begining with # are not taken into account for the commit message.
#
# You might want to use one of this labels to prefix your commit message.
# Uncomment (delete the # char) the proper line to directly use it:
#
#fix: 
#new: 
#change: 
#refactor: 
#typo: 
#change: 
#revert: 
#doc: 
#
#
# If you are doing a partial commit (e.g. the feature is not yet finished,
# or the code doesn't properly work but you want to save the state of the
# work) you might want to prefix the message with [WIP]:
#
#[WIP] fix: 
#[WIP] new: 
#[WIP] change: 
#[WIP] refactor: 
#[WIP] typo: 
#
#
# After editing the message, save and quit your editor, e.g. in vim
# with 'ZZ' or ':wq'. If you exit without modifing the message or
# with a blank message, the commit is aborted.
