Mixing jQueryUI and Font Awesome
================================

The images used for icons in jQueryUI can be replaced with icons from
the embedded Font Awesome collection.  Essentially, the style in the
override.css file needs to be applied.  Then the icons as defined in
the Font Awesome stylesheet can then be used as replacements for the
jQueryUI icons--just use the name of the icon.
